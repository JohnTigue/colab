        "There are two directories of interest:\n",
        "* `probings/`: one-off learning tests to probe the state of the VM\n",

        "## Tools\n",

        "\n",
        "Colab and Binder are similar but there are subtle differences, beyond the open (Binder) versus closed (Colab) source issue. Of course, Google is giving away an addictively useful service with Colab and much of the closed source is for dialing Jupyter to their service. So, if you need more freedom, go get a free temporary VM at https://mybinder.org, where you bring your own code and as such can do anything. Of course, there are no free GPUs and TPUs on mybinder.org.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Terminology\n",
        "Herein, the follow terms are used:\n",
        "* \"Colab\" means colab.research.google.com \n",
        "* \"Binder\" means the free Binder service hosted at mybinder.org\n",
        "\n",
        "### Similarities\n",
        "* both  give a user a temporary virtual machine (VM)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Differences\n",
        "* Colab only models independent notebook files.\n",
        "* Binder models a repo full of notebooks in a single Docker image.\n",
        "\n",
        "This means that cross-notebook connections are less powerful on Colab than on Binder."
