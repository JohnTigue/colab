        "\n",
        "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnTigue/colab-ing/blob/master/tools/allensdk_on_colab.ipynb)\n",
        "\n",
        "The [Allen Institute for Brain Science](https://www.alleninstitute.org/) (AIBS) maintains an SDK, called [`the Allen SDK`](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/AllenSDK), for working with their resources ([data](http://portal.brain-map.org/) and software). This notebook, `allensdk_on_colab.ipynb`, is focused on nothing except the installation of the Allen SDK on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).\n",
        "\n",
        "The following snippets were tested on Colab in new notebooks, for both options available on Colab: Python 2 and Python 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "Herein, `AllenSDK` and `allensdk` refer to the Python package that gets `import`ed. Separately, \"the Allen SDK\" is `AllenSDK` plus further documentation, example code, etc. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Motivation\n",
        "This notebook was built out while working through – on Colab – AIBS' pedagogical Jupyter notebooks in both the Allen SDK and their [Allen Summer Workshop on the Dynamic Brain repository on GitHub](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/SWDB_2018).\n",
        "\n",
        "The Allen SDK documentation includes example Jupyter notebooks for [how to use `AllenSDK`](https://alleninstitute.github.io/AllenSDK/examples.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "Separately, AIBS holds an annual two week retreat, the Summer Workshop on the Dynamic Brain (SWDB), where they train up promising new neuroscientist on how to do science with AIBS' data and tools. The main pedagogical medium of SWDB is Jupyter notebooks, which can be found on GitHub in [AllenInstitute/SWDB_2018](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/SWDB_2018).\n",
        "\n",
        "The SWDB notebooks assume that [`AllenSDK` is preinstalled](http://alleninstitute.github.io/AllenSDK/install.html#installation-with-docker-optional). That is, in order to get an arbitrary, as-found-on-GitHub SWDB notebook to work in Colab, a `!pip install allensdk` is required first – in every notebook file. (Unlike [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), Colab does not model a whole git repo of notebooks, only individual notebook files separately.)\n",
        "\n",
        "**TODO:** what the deal about installing in one `.ipynb` and seeing that in another `.ipynb`.\n",
        "\n",
        "This file makes it trivial to repeat (and debug) `AllenSDK` installs as needed – which can be rather frequent on Colab. The `pip install` is just one line; the real value here is more the collection of debug tools that come in handy if set-up is not going well.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Install This File as Colab Custom Snippets\n",
        "This notebook reads well enough as one sequential story but the text is really designed to read well as individual snippets, in Colab's code snippet insert dialog.\n",
        "\n",
        "To \"install\" these snippets in your Colab snippets library:\n",
        "* Load this file in Colab\n",
        "* Copy the URL (~`https://colab.research.google.com\\...`)\n",
        "* In any Colab page, from the menus select `Tools=>Preferences...` \n",
        "* In `Custom snippet notebook URL`, paste the URL\n",
        "* Press `Save`\n",
        "* Reload\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: Colab does allow for multiple simultaneous `Custom snippet notebook URLs`... sometimes and sometimes not.\n",
        "\n",
        "After the above set-up, it's trivial to insert cells that install and test `AllenSDK`.  For example, load in Colab a SWDB notebook, say [`BrainObservatory.ipynb`](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/SWDB_2018/blob/master/DynamicBrain/BrainObservatory.ipynb), then simply select `Insert => Code snippet...` and search for `allensdk` and the following come up:\n",
        "![allensdk_snippets_in_menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnTigue/colab-ing/master/images/allensdk_snippets_in_colab.png =330x280)\n",
        "\n",
        "Select `Install AllenSDK` and run the resulting code cell, after which the Allen SWDB notebooks should work on Colab. Your modification will not persist in the GitHub hosted repo (i.e. the notebook is in playground mode). Ergo, these snippets provide a relatively easy way to play with the SWDB notebooks on Colab, short of forking the original repo... which is what Colab is really useful for."
