Doing it this way (as a separate file) is useful when working with the [Allen SWDB repo's](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/SWDB_2018) notebooks, which assume that `AllenSDK` is already installed. I.e. in order to get an arbitrary as-found-on-GitHub SWDB notebook to work in Colab a `!pip install allensdk` line is required, in every notebook file. This file is how to hack around that issue.\n",

Set that up, and it's trivial to just insert the necessary set-up code into the SWDB notebooks. Assuming one of those notebooks, say [`BrainObservatory.ipynb`](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/SWDB_2018/blob/master/DynamicBrain/BrainObservatory.ipynb), were opened in Colab, then simply `Insert => Code snippet...` and search for `Install AllenSDK`. Run the resulting code cell, and the notebook should work on Colab. Your modification will not persist in the GitHub hosted repo. Ergo, a relatively easy way to play with the notebooks in that repo."
