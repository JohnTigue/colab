        "# AllenSDK on Colab\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook, `allensdk_on_colab.ipynb`, is simply a collections of snippets for installing/uninstalled [`AllenSDK`](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/AllenSDK) and tools to test installs. \n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook reads well enough as one sequential story but the text is really designed to read well when read as individual snippets, in Colab's Code snippet insert dialog.\n",
        "\n",
        "These snippets were tested on Colab for both Python 2 and Python 3 new notebooks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Motivation\n",
        "Having these snippets in their own separate notebook is useful when working with the [Allen SWDB repo's](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/SWDB_2018) notebooks, which assume that [`AllenSDK` is already installed](http://alleninstitute.github.io/AllenSDK/install.html#installation-with-docker-optional). That is, in order to get an arbitrary, as-found-on-GitHub SWDB notebook to work in Colab, a `!pip install allensdk` line is required â€“ in every notebook file. (Unlike [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), Colab does not model a whole git repo of notebooks, only individual notebook files). This file makes the work-around to be trivially repeat as needed. The `pip install` is just one line, the real value here is more the collection of debug tools that come in handy if set-up is not going well.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Install this file as Colab custom snippets\n",
        "The most convenient way to use this file is to grab its URL (something along the lines of `https://colab.research.google.com\\...`) and use it as a value for `Custom snippet notebook URL`, which can be set in the dialog that comes up upon selecting `Tools=>Preferences...` from the menus. Set that up, and it's trivial to just insert the necessary set-up code into the SWDB notebooks. Assuming one of those notebooks, say [`BrainObservatory.ipynb`](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/SWDB_2018/blob/master/DynamicBrain/BrainObservatory.ipynb), were opened in Colab, then simply `Insert => Code snippet...` and search for `allensdk` and the following come up:\n",
        "\n",
        "![allensdk_snippets_in_menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnTigue/colab-ing/master/images/allensdk_snippets_in_colab.png =330x280)\n",
        "\n",
        "Insert `Install AllenSDK` and run the resulting code cell, and the Allen SWDB notebook should work on Colab. Your modification will not persist in the GitHub hosted repo. Ergo, a relatively easy way to play with the notebooks in that repo."
